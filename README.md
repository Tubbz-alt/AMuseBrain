# AmuseBrain
---------------

is an app interface that utilizes Muse and MuseLab SDK. It extracts a neural signal from four different channels and then an analysis is carried out to detect an intent of thought by eye closure. The eye closure makes the event related potential in the neural signal on the action being performed which is recorded by Muse. The event related potential being elicited by eye closure is then further interfaced with an hardware system (Arduino) which show concepts of Home Automation.

Through the fundamental programming concepts of Math, Computer Science and incorporating techniques of socket client interaction, filteration procedures and threshold classification we have been able to scroll web page pn repititive eye closing behaviour for some small amounts every time.

# Hardware Requirements
-------------------------

1. Arduino-UNO
2. Muse Headgear


# Other 
-------
1. Muse Labs SDK
2. Arduino Package (can be downloaded from application if you get the other requirements)

# Usage
---------

1. To connect to the website and connect using your Muse headband
2. Check your device connections by following the web client
3. Easy interaction with eye closure scroll
4. Analysis shown for academic knowledge and variable real time change
